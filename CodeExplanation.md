Data Preprocessing:

The script reads a shapefile using geopandas and normalizes specific columns (Gamma_CPS, CntTimeS, BKGD, r) using MinMaxScaler from sklearn.

Data Setup:

A set of angles (angles) and corresponding relative efficiency (rel_eff_data) are provided, which seem to relate to some form of detection efficiency or response across different angles.

Various constants like background_count_rate_bq, Pdesired, activity, and others are defined to represent physical or measurement parameters for the system.

Model Setup:

An enhanced version of a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is implemented with several hidden layers and dropout for regularization.

The model architecture includes layers with ReLU activation, batch normalization, and dropout layers to enhance generalization.

Loss Functions:

The script defines a custom physics-based loss function physics_loss that incorporates physical laws related to detection probability, background noise, and the desired detection probability (Pdesired).

The loss includes both data-driven components (like mean squared error) and physics-informed terms (like detection probability and false positives).

Model Training:

A custom training loop (train_step) is used to optimize the model with both the physics loss and data loss components.

The training loop also tracks metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² for both training and validation sets.

An early stopping mechanism is implemented to halt training if validation loss does not improve for a set number of epochs.

Detection Calculations:

Two methods are defined for calculating the Maximum Detectable Distance (MDD), which appear to be dependent on whether the detection system is mobile or immobile.

The mobile detection method uses a more complex approach involving distances traveled, while the immobile method calculates MDD based on a fixed distance.

Post-Training Evaluation:

After training, the model is evaluated on both the training and validation data to calculate the final loss and metrics.

Depending on the setting (is_mobile), the script calculates the MDD (in inches or meters).

Potential Improvements and Considerations:
Model Architecture:

The current model is heavily regularized with dropout layers. It might be useful to experiment with reducing the dropout rate or using other regularization techniques to avoid underfitting.

Loss Function Normalization:

There is normalization of both data loss and physics loss, which helps balance the contributions of both terms. You might want to experiment with adjusting the physics_loss_weight to see if a different balance yields better performance.

Early Stopping Logic:

The early stopping logic in the training loop seems to be based on a patience_count mechanism that is triggered when validation loss increases. Ensure that this is well-tuned and working as expected to prevent unnecessary training.

Debugging Outputs:

The script contains print statements inside various functions (such as physics_loss, MDD calculations), which can help debug and trace the values during training. Consider reducing the verbosity in the final version to avoid clutter in the logs.

Visualization:

It would be useful to visualize the training and validation loss curves over time to monitor the progress of the training process.

Model Performance Metrics:

Additional metrics such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) or other regression metrics could be considered to get a fuller picture of the model's performance.
